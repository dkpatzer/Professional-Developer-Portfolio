# Professional-Developer-Portfolio

## Description
 
 This is a professional portfolio to showcase my work and skills to potential employers. It contains a short bio, a list of projects, and a contact form. The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is responsive and mobile friendly.

 This app allowed me to practice and improve my skills in writing HTML including using links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, using semantic HTML elements, adding images and using Bootstrap to create a responsive layout. I also practiced using CSS to style the page and make it more visually appealing.

## Installation
I began by setting up a basic HTML structure including the head section, header, nav,and main,celements. I added a link to the Bootstrap CSS file, the second link for the Google font 'Alegreya', and a link to my own style.css file. I began the header section including my navbar markup links. I then outlined my basic css file including the body and navbar styling. I then worked on the main section, adding links and pictures of projects I worked on individiually, adding and modifying the CSS as I went along.

## Usage

The portfolio follows the User Story and Acceptance Criteria below:
