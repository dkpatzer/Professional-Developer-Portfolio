    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am a physician/surgeon/psychiatrist who became absorbed with web design and coding after seeing many medical websites and electronic medical records that were not user friendly. I studied code the same way I studied medicine and have come up with innovative solutions to meet all of your needs. My psychiatric background has allowed me to have a deeper understanding of how people think and ways to engage customers at a deep and meaningful level.</p>
